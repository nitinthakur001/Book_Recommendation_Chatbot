Intents are the objectives of every bot. They represent the goal or purpose of a user question.
Entities allow to collect specific details in the user question. The best way to think about entities is that they are the SUBJECTS of intents.

The dialog in the Conversation API is like a conditional responses.. more like a logic tree with many switch case ... or if then conditions. 
Each intent begins a node on the left and the logic flows from the top down through your intents. 
If a certain intent is triggered by an utterance, its node is opened and the logic continues to entities.
Setting up your dialog flow is all about logic.
